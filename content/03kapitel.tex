\label{chap:summary}

This Tunable Diode Laser Absorption Spectroscopy (TDLAS) experiment introduced the basics of both absorption spectroscopy and tunable diode laser setups. It showed the strengths in an easy experiment setup with comparable large output, as well as its weaknesses in terms of error susceptibility, data interpretation, and needed knowledge.

It was possible to create a fingerprint-like absorption spectra resp. extinction measurement for two species, illustrate the benefits of simultaneous measurements and show influences on signal deviations or reductions.
